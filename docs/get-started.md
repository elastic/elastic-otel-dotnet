Goal of this doc:
The user is able to successfully see data from their .NET application make it to the Elastic UI via the Elastic Distribution of OpenTelemetry .NET

Assumptions we're comfortable making about the reader:
* They are familiar with Elastic
* They are familiar with OpenTelemetry
* They have dotnet installed
-->

# Get started

> [!WARNING]
> The Elastic Distribution of OpenTelemetry .NET is not yet recommended for production use. Functionality may be changed or removed in future releases. Alpha releases are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.
>
> We welcome your feedback! You can reach us by [opening a GitHub issue](https://github.com/elastic/elastic-otel-dotnet/issues) or starting a discussion thread on the [Elastic Discuss forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/tags/c/observability/apm/58/dotnet).

This guide shows you how to use the Elastic Distribution of OpenTelemetry .NET (EDOT .NET) to instrument your .NET application and send OpenTelemetry data to an Elastic Observability deployment.

**Already familiar with OpenTelemetry?** It's an explicit goal of this distribution to introduce _no new concepts_ outside those defined by the wider OpenTelemetry community.

**New to OpenTelemetry?** This section will guide you through the _minimal_ configuration options to get EDOT Java set up in your application. You do _not_ need any existing experience with OpenTelemetry to set up EDOT Java initially. If you need more control over your configuration after getting set up, you can learn more in the [OpenTelemetry documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/net).

> [!NOTE]
> As an OpenTelemetry SDK, EDOT .NET supports sending data to any OpenTelemetry protocol (OTLP) endpoint ([OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/)), but this guide assumes you are sending data to Elastic.

<!-- ✅ What the user needs to know and/or do before they install EDOT .NET -->
## Prerequisites

Before getting started:

* **Check your .NET SDK version**. The current documentation and examples are written with .NET 6 and newer applications in mind. Before continuing, ensure that you have a supported [.NET SDK version](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet) installed locally.
* **Set up Elastic Observability**. You'll need somewhere to send the gathered OpenTelemetry data, so it can be viewed and analyzed. This doc assumes you're using an [Elastic Observability](https://www.elastic.co/observability) cloud deployment. You can use an existing one or set up a new one.

<!-- ✅ How to install EDOT .NET -->
## Install

<!-- ✅ Step-by-step instructions -->
To get started with the Elastic OpenTelemetry Distribution for .NET, add the `Elastic.OpenTelemetry` NuGet package reference to your project file:

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Elastic.OpenTelemetry" Version="<LATEST>" />
```

> [!NOTE]
> Replace the `<LATEST>` placeholder with the latest available package from [NuGet.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Elastic.OpenTelemetry).

After adding the package reference, you can start using EDOT .NET in your application.

<!-- ✅ Any additional info related to installation -->
> [!NOTE]
> EDOT .NET includes a transitive dependency on the OpenTelemetry SDK, so you do not _need_ to add the OpenTelemetry SDK package to your project directly. However, you _can_ explicitly add the OpenTelemetry SDK as a dependency if you want to opt into newer SDK versions. If you do this, the OpenTelemetry SDK dependency must be defined _before_ the Elastic OpenTelemetry Distribution for .NET is defined.

> [!NOTE]
> EDOT .NET is designed to be easy to use and integrate into your applications. This includes applications that have previously used the OpenTelemetry SDK directly. In situations where the OpenTelemetry SDK is already used, the only required change is to add the `Elastic.OpenTelemetry` NuGet package to the project. Doing so will automatically switch to the opinionated configuration provided by EDOT .NET.

<!-- ✅ Start-to-finish operation -->
## Instrument your application

The OpenTelemetry SDK and EDOT .NET provide extension methods to enable observability features in your application with a few lines of code. Choose from:

* [**ASP.NET Core application**](#aspnet-core-application) for ASP.NET Core minimal API applications, other ASP.NET Core workloads and other host-based applications like [worker services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/workers).
* [**`Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting`**](#microsoftextensionshosting) for console applications and services that are written against a builder that exposes an `IServiceCollection`.
* [**Manual instrumentation**](#manual-instrumentation) for environments where an `IServiceCollection` is unavailable.

### ASP.NET Core application

If you want to instrument an ASP.NET Core minimal API application using EDOT .NET, follow the
steps below. Similar steps can also be used to instrument other ASP.NET Core workloads and other
host-based applications like [worker services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/workers).

> [!NOTE]
> The examples below assume your code uses the top-level statements feature introduced in C# 9.0 and the default choice for applications created using the latest templates.

<!-- ✅ Any dependencies that need to be installed in addition to EDOT .NET -->
1. To take advantage of the OpenTelemetry SDK instrumentation for ASP.NET Core, add the following NuGet package to your project:
    ```xml
    <PackageReference Include="OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore" Version="<LATEST>" />
    ```

    This package includes instrumentation to collect traces for requests handled by ASP.NET Core endpoints.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The ASP.NET Core instrumentation is not included by default in EDOT .NET. As with all optional instrumentation libraries, you can choose to include them in your application by adding a suitable package reference.

1. Inside the `Program.cs` file of the ASP.NET Core application, add the following two `using` directives:

    ```csharp
using OpenTelemetry;
using OpenTelemetry.Trace;
    ```

    The OpenTelemetry SDK provides extension methods on the `IServiceCollection` to enable the providers and configure the SDK. EDOT .NET overrides the default OpenTelemetry SDK registration, adding several opinionated defaults.

1. In the minimal API template, the `WebApplicationBuilder` exposes a `Services` property that can be used to register services with the dependency injection container. To enable tracing and metrics collection, ensure that the OpenTelemetry SDK is registered:

    ```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services
	// The `AddHttpClient` method registers the `IHttpClientFactory` service with
	// the dependency injection container. This is NOT required to enable OpenTelemetry,
	// but the example endpoint will use it to send an HTTP request.
	.AddHttpClient()
	// The `AddOpenTelemetry` method registers the OpenTelemetry SDK with the
	// dependency injection container. When available, EDOT .NET will override
	// this to add opinionated defaults.
	.AddOpenTelemetry()
	// Configure tracing to instrument requests handled by ASP.NET Core.
	.WithTracing(t => t.AddAspNetCoreInstrumentation());
    ```

With these limited changes to the `Program.cs` file, the application is now configured to use the
OpenTelemetry SDK and EDOT .NET to collect traces and metrics, which are exported via the
OpenTelemetry protocol (OTLP).

To demonstrate the tracing capabilities, add a simple endpoint to the application:

```csharp
app.MapGet("/", async (IHttpClientFactory httpClientFactory) =>
{
	using var client = httpClientFactory.CreateClient();

	await Task.Delay(100);
	// Using this URL will require two redirects, allowing us to
	// see multiple spans in the trace.
	var response = await client.GetAsync("http://elastic.co"); <1>
	await Task.Delay(50);

	return response.StatusCode == System.Net.HttpStatusCode.OK ? Results.Ok() : Results.StatusCode(500);
});
```

EDOT .NET will automatically enable the exporting of signals via the OTLP exporter. This
exporter requires that endpoint(s) are configured. A common mechanism for configuring
endpoints is via environment variables.

### `Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting`

<!-- ✅ Any dependencies that need to be installed in addition to EDOT .NET -->
For console applications, services, etc that are written against a builder that exposes an `IServiceCollection` you can install this package:

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Elastic.OpenTelemetry" Version="<LATEST>" />
```

> [!NOTE]
> Replace the `<LATEST>` placeholder with the latest available package from [NuGet.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Elastic.OpenTelemetry).

Ensure you call `AddOpenTelemetry` to enable OpenTelemetry just as you would when using OpenTelemetry directly. Our package intercepts this call to set up our defaults, but can be further build upon as per usual:

```csharp
var builder = Host.CreateApplicationBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddOpenTelemetry()
	.ConfigureResource(r => r.AddService(serviceName: "MyService"))
	.WithTracing(t => t.AddSource(Worker.ActivitySourceName).AddConsoleExporter())
	.WithMetrics(m => m.AddMeter(Worker.MeterName).AddConsoleExporter());
```

### Manual instrumentation

In environments where an `IServiceCollection` is unavailable you may manually start instrumenting by creating an instance of `ElasticOpenTelemetryBuilder`.

```csharp
await using var session = new ElasticOpenTelemetryBuilder()
	.WithTracing(b => b.AddSource(ActivitySourceName))
	.Build();
```

This will setup instrumentation for as long as `session` is not disposed. We would generally expect the `session`
to live for the life of the application.

`ElasticOpenTelemetryBuilder` is an implementation of [`IOpenTelemetryBuilder`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/blob/70657395b82ba00b8a1e848e8832b77dff94b6d2/src/OpenTelemetry.Api.ProviderBuilderExtensions/IOpenTelemetryBuilder.cs#L12).

This is important to know because any instrumentation configuration is automatically exposed by the base
OpenTelemetry package as extension methods on `IOpenTelemetryBuilder`. You will not lose functionality by
using our builder.

<!-- ✅ Provide _minimal_ configuration/setup -->
## Configure EDOT .NET

To configure EDOT .NET, at a minimum you'll need the deployment's OTLP endpoint and
authorization data to set the appropriate `OTLP_*` environment variables:

* `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`: The full URL of the endpoint where data will be sent.
* `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`: A comma-separated list of `key=value` pairs that will
be added to the headers of every request. This is typically this is used for
authentication information.

You can find the values of these variables in Kibana's APM tutorial. In Kibana:

<!-- ✅ Step-by-step instructions -->
1. Go to **Setup guides**.
1. Select **Observability**.
1. Select **Monitor my application performance**.
1. Scroll down and select the **OpenTelemetry** option.
1. The appropriate values for `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` and `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` are shown there.

    ![Elastic Cloud OpenTelemetry configuration](images/elastic-cloud-opentelemetry-configuration.png)

    For example:

    ```sh
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://my-deployment.apm.us-west1.gcp.cloud.es.io
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="Authorization=Bearer P....l"
    ```
1. Configure environment variables for the application either in `launchSettings.json` or in the environment where the application is running.
1. Once configured, run the application and make a request to the root endpoint. A trace will be generated and exported to the OTLP endpoint.

For more information on all the available configuration options, refer to [Configuration](./configure.md).

<!-- ✅ What success looks like -->
## Confirm that EDOT .NET is working

To confirm that EDOT .NET has successfully connected to Elastic:

1. In Kibana, go to **Observability** → **Applications** → **Traces**.
1. You should see the name of the service to which you just added EDOT .NET. It can take several minutes after setting up EDOT .NET for the service to show up in this list.
1. Click on the name of the service in the list to see traces.
