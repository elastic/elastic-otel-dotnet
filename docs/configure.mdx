Configuration of the OpenTelemetry SDK should be performed through the
mechanisms [documented on the OpenTelemetry website](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/net/automatic/configuration/).

The Elastic Distribution for OpenTelemetry .NET can be further configured using advanced settings when
you need complete control of its behaviour. Configuration can be achieved by setting environment variables,
using the `IConfiguration` integration, or manually configuring the Elastic distribution.

## Environment variables

The Elastic Distribution for OpenTelemetry .NET can be configured using environment variables. This is a cross-platform
way to configure the Elastic Distribution for OpenTelemetry .NET and is especially useful in containerized environments.

Environment variables are read at startup and can be used to configure the Elastic distribution.
For details of the various options available and their corresponding environment variable names,
see [configuration otpions](#configuration_options).

Environment variables always take precedence over configuration provided by the `IConfiguration`
system.

## IConfiguration integration

In applications that use the "host" pattern, such as ASP.NET Core and worker service, the Elastic
distribution can be configured using the `IConfiguration` integration. This is done by passing an
`IConfiguration` instance to the `AddElasticOpenTelemetry` extension method on the `IServiceCollection`.

When using an `IHostApplicationBuilder` such as modern ASP.NET Core applications, the current `IConfiguration`
can be accessed via the `Configuration` property on the builder.

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var currentConfig = builder.Configuration; [^1]
```
[^1]: Access the current `IConfiguration` instance from the builder.

By default, at this stage, the configuration will be populated from the default configuration sources,
including the `appsettings.json` file(s) and command-line arguments. You may use these sources to define
the configuration for the Elastic Distribution for OpenTelemetry .NET.

For example, you can define the configuration for the Elastic Distribution for OpenTelemetry .NET in the `appsettings.json` file:

```json
{
  "Elastic": {
    "OpenTelemetry": {
      "FileLogDirectory": "C:\\Logs" [^1]
    }
  }
}
```
[^1]: This example sets the file log directory to `C:\Logs` which enables diagnostic file logging.

Configuration from the "Elastic:OpenTelemetry" section of the `IConfiguration` instance will be
bound to the `ElasticOpenTelemetryOptions` instance used to configure the Elastic distribution.

To learn more about the Microsoft configuration system, see
[Configuration in ASP.NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration).

## Manual configuration

In all other scenarios, configuration can be achieved manually in code. This is done by creating
an instance of `ElasticOpenTelemetryBuilderOptions` and passing it to the `ElasticOpenTelemetryBuilder` constructor
or an overload of the `AddElasticOpenTelemetry` extension method on the `IServiceCollection`.

For example, in traditional console applications, you can configure the Elastic Distribution for OpenTelemetry .NET like this:

```csharp
using Elastic.OpenTelemetry;
using Elastic.OpenTelemetry.Configuration;
using Elastic.OpenTelemetry.Extensions;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using OpenTelemetry;

var services = new ServiceCollection();

var builderOptions = new ElasticOpenTelemetryBuilderOptions [^1]
{
	DistroOptions = new ElasticOpenTelemetryOptions [^2]
	{
		FileLogDirectory = "C:\\Logs", [^3]
	}
};

await using var session = new ElasticOpenTelemetryBuilder(builderOptions) [^4]
	.WithTracing(b => b.AddSource("MySource"))
	.Build();
```
[^1]: Create an instance of `ElasticOpenTelemetryBuilderOptions`
[^2]: Create an instance of `ElasticOpenTelemetryOptions` and configure the file log directory by
setting the corresponding property.
[^3]: This example sets the file log directory to `C:\Logs` which enables diagnostic file logging.
[^4]: Pass the `ElasticOpenTelemetryBuilderOptions` instance to the `ElasticOpenTelemetryBuilder` constructor
to configure the Elastic Distribution for OpenTelemetry .NET.

## Configuration options

### `FileLogDirectory`

A string specifying the directory where the Elastic Distribution for OpenTelemetry .NET will write diagnostic log files.
When not provided, no file logging will occur. Each new .NET process will create a new log file in the
specified directory.

| Environment variable name | IConfiguration key |
| ------------- |-------------|
| `ELASTIC_OTEL_FILE_LOG_DIRECTORY` | `Elastic:OpenTelemetry:FileLogDirectory` |

| Default | Type |
| ------------- |-------------|
| `string.Empty` | String |

### `FileLogLevel`

Sets the logging level for the distribtuion.

Valid options: `Critical`, `Error`, `Warning`, `Information`, `Debug`, `Trace` and `None` (`None` disables the logging).

| Environment variable name | IConfiguration key |
| ------------- |-------------|
| `ELASTIC_OTEL_FILE_LOG_LEVEL` | `Elastic:OpenTelemetry:FileLogLevel` |

| Default | Type |
| ------------- |-------------|
| `Information` | String |

### `SkipOtlpExporter`

Allows the distribution to used with its defaults, but without enabling the export of telemetry data to
an OTLP endpoint. This can be useful when you want to test applications without sending telemetry data.

| Environment variable name | IConfiguration key |
| ------------- |-------------|
| `ELASTIC_OTEL_SKIP_OTLP_EXPORTER` | `Elastic:OpenTelemetry:SkipOtlpExporter` |

| Default | Type |
| ------------- |-------------|
| `false` | Bool |

[float]
[[config-enabledelasticdefaults]]
### `EnabledElasticDefaults`

A comma-separated list of Elastic defaults to enable. This can be useful when you want to enable
only some of the Elastic Distribution for OpenTelemetry .NET opinionated defaults.

Valid options: `None`, `Tracing`, `Metrics`, `Logging`.

Except for the `None` option, all other options can be combined.

When this setting is not configured or the value is `string.Empty`, all Elastic Distribution for OpenTelemetry .NET defaults will be enabled.

When `None` is specified, no Elastic Distribution for OpenTelemetry .NET defaults will be enabled, and you will need to manually
configure the OpenTelemetry SDK to enable collection of telemetry signals. In this mode, the Elastic distribution
does not provide any opinionated defaults, nor register any processors, allowing you to start with the "vanilla"
OpenTelemetry SDK configuration. You may then choose to configure the various providers and register processors
as required.

In all other cases, the Elastic Distribution for OpenTelemetry .NET will enable the specified defaults. For example, to enable only
Elastic defaults only for tracing and metrics, set this value to `Tracing,Metrics`.

| Environment variable name | IConfiguration key |
| ------------- |-------------|
| `ELASTIC_OTEL_ENABLE_ELASTIC_DEFAULTS` | `Elastic:OpenTelemetry:EnabledElasticDefaults` |

| Default | Type |
| ------------- |-------------|
| `string.Empty` | String |
