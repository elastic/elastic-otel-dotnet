The `Elastic.OpenTelemetry` package contains an Elastic Distribution for OpenTelemetry .NET of the
[OpenTelemetry SDK for .NET](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/net). A distribution
is a wrapper around an upstream OpenTelemetry repository with some customizations. For
more details about distributions in general, visit the
[OpenTelemetry documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/distributions).

The Elastic Distribution for OpenTelemtry .NET includes some Elastic-specific processors to ensure the best
compatibility when exporting OpenTelemetry signal data to an Elastic backend such
as Elastic APM server. The distribution also preconfigures the collection of tracing
and metrics signals, applying some opinionated defaults, such as which sources are
collected by default. The distribution also ensures that the OTLP exporter is enabled
by default.

The distribution includes extension methods to fully control the creation of the
underlying tracer and metric providers, providing a helpful set of defaults
to get developers up and running quickly with collecting and exporting OpenTelemetry
signals.
